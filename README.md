# Recomendation-Engine
Build a system to be able to recommend books to a user. Think NetFlix or Amazon. You need to be able to enter book information, ratings, users etc. Use one of two basic models to find a recommendation.
Model #1: Find another user most like the current user and recommend books they liked.
Model #2: Rate the book for various facets (author, genre etc.) and find out how it matches to the readers past recommendations.
We will discuss this in class and there are several readings in the Recommendation Engine Folder.
You should build a minimal working version first and then think about revisions.
